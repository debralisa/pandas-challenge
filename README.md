Pandas and Jupyter Notebook Data Analysis

##Project Challenge:
"You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance." Module 4 Challenge Project

##Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, data will be analyzed from 2 files (student_complete.csv and schools_complete.csv).

#A: Files will be read and then calculations run in order to perform a District level/high-level snapshot of the key metrics in a DataFrame.
#B: Perform calculations to create a school summary based DataFrame.
#C: Perform calculations to determine the top 5 school with % overall passing (in math and reading score), displayed in a DataFrame.
#D: Perform calculations to determine the bottom 5 school with % overall passing (in math and reading score), displayed in a DataFrame.
#E: Preate 2 seperate DataFrames giving average student math scores per grade per school and average student reading scores per grade per school.
#F: Create a DataFrame using bins to create table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). The challenge gives some code suggestions to work with.   I had quite a bit of trouble with some code calculations and finally made my own code for the calculations to success.
#G: Similar to F, create a DataFrame by using bins to create a table to breaks down the school performance based on school size (small, medium, large).  Similar coding calculation issues were had from the code supplied, so new code was generated successfully after much trial and error.
#H: Create a DataFrame to show school performance by school type (charter or district)
#I: Report Analysis write up.  Brief overall analysis gathered from data calculations is given along with 2 conclusions based on analysis.
